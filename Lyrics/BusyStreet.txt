Runnin' down on Busy Street,
So many, just don't meet.
Doin' what I think is right,
God, just ain't got no sight.
What I'm thinkin'.

Livin's just a losers game,
We're all in it, so who's
to blame.
What if there is a hell,
Where I'm goin', can't really
tell?
What I'm thinkin'.

Don't know why I should
choose,
Darkness with all it's blues,
When there's a life I see,
In some leads heavenly,
What I'm thinkin'.

If things are crook for you
now, can you imagine
what it will be like if it
never ever changes, and
it stays that way for all of
ETERNITY?

Man said just the other day,
"Do I really want this way?"
Called over just to say,
Jesus loved me today.
What's He thinkin'?

Maybe I'll think again,
Lifes hard, well now and then.
But, if what he said is true,
That this Jesus loves me too,
I'd be livin'!
