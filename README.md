# VIEWu
Universal Song Viewing App  (Desktops/Tablets/Mobiles)

viewu.htm is the main program. Will work in any browser. 
However, Android (and probably iOS) have restrictions on using local files.
The htm.view.apk Android App is included here to overcome this problem. *see wiki for usage

help.htm and morehelp.htm explain how things work.

Songs lyrics are created in basic .txt format and stored locally in subfolders where view.htm resides.

Background pictures can be added. These are kept in the images folder or grouped beneath the images folder.

Karaoke mode works. .mp3 files are kept in the media folder.

Lyrics folders can be named anything as long as they have a capitalised first letter. Keep these names very short.
Why? because a companion Chrome browser app exists which uses the same set of files with a dual screen output.
It has tabs for song books *see chromeview git repo*
Keep all other folder names as they are and use accordingly.
