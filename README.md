# VIEWu
Universal Song Viewing App  (Desktops/Tablets/Mobiles)

viewu.htm is the main program. Will work in any browser. 
However, Android (and probably iOS) have restrictions on using local files.
An Android App will be made available to overcome this (email me for now). 

help.htm and morehelp.htm explai how things work 
Songs lyrics are created in basic .txt format and stored locally in subfolders where view.htm resides
Background pictures can be added. These are kept in the images folder or grouped beneath the images folder.
Karaoke mode works. .mp3 files are kept in the media folder.
Lyrics folders can be named anything as long as they have a capitalised first letter. Keep names very short.
Why? because a companion Chrome browser app exists which uses the same set of files with a dual screen output.
